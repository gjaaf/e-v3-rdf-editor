## Further Work

Areas that I might do more work on:

- Add support for property graphs (especially Neo4j). Given that the complexity of the Neo4j model is a lot lower than the RDF model, this should not be a major problem.
- Adjust queries for Ontop.
- Use a web-based geo visualization to also allow non-point objects.
- And probably a lot more when more work is done with the tool.
