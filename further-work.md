## Further work

Area's that I might do more work on:

- Add support for property graphs (especially Neo4J).
  Gieven that the complxity of the Neu4J model is a lot lower thatn the RDF model, this should not be major problem.
- adjust queries for Ontop.
- Use a webbased goe visualization to also allow non-point objects.
- And probably a lot more when ore wok is done with the tool.
