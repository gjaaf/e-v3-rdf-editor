Introduction

[Ontop](https://ontop-vkg.org/guide/) is a Virtual Knowledge Graph system. It exposes the content of
arbitrary relational databases as knowledge graphs. These graphs are
virtual, which means that data remains in the data sources instead of
being moved to another database.

Ontop translates SPARQL queries (opens new window) expressed over the
knowledge graphs into SQL queries executed by the relational data
sources. It relies on R2RML mappings and can take advantage of lightweight ontologies.
