## Conclusions
The project was started with [3 questions]({% link introduction.md %}).

The answer is positive on all three.

- Yes, it is possible to get an idea of the content of a store. But you
  need to know some stuff. Like that the rdf:type predicates ar (in
  our case) almost always pointing to an object. This means the
  expansion mechanism 'incomping arc's' must be used to find instances
  of a class. So this still requires a basis ondersteingin of RDF. If
  a reverse predicate (has-instance) would be available the discivery
  would be much easier.

- Yes, is is possible to create an editing tool for rdf-stores.

- Yes, emacs (as an open source tool) can be used to this. In fact, for
 quick development of something where the entire functionality cannot
 be determined the malleability of emacs helps a lot for developing
 something like this.
