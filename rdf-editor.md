RDF-Editor

RDF Editor is a research project that was started while working for
the Dutch Government on a project involving the exchange of large
amounts of Linked Data. I noticed that there was very limited tooling
available to work with the datasets we received and sent. This led to
the central questions that were addressed by the creation of this
tool.
 
As the project is now largely complete, some may find it useful or
draw inspiration from it for other projects, especially within the
Emacs community. I'm documenting RDF-Editor here for that reason.

I may do more work on this, though other research areas may take
priority. Contact me if you want to know more or if you would like to
contribute to RDF-Editor at gja at freeshell dot org.
