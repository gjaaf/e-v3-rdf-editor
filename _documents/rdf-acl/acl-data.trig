# ACL-DATA
# Demonstration data for access control mechanismes in RDF-stores, used on Fuseki
#
# This set contaoins an empty default graph.
# The graph objects contains object that are not top-secret, the graph secret-objects are the object that are top-secret and which need a special access priviledge.
# The graph region1 contains the data for region1
# The graph region2 contains the data for region2
# The object contain a reference to the region and the region graphs are access controlled, so that a query that request objects with a region should use access control mechanisms.
# A user Alice that has access to the region1 graph, should only see objects from region 1
# A user Bob that has access to the region2 graph, should only see objects from region 2
# Both of then have only access to the not top-secret graph, so no secret data should be shown
# A user John, that has access to the region1 graph and the top-secret graph should see top-secret objects from region1
# A user Theresa, that has access to the region1 graph and the region2 graph and the top-secret graph and the not top-secret object graph should see all obejcts from all regions
# Note this only can work if the query includes the region information
# If however the default graph contains all subjects (so all objects) without any further information... It still does not work. :-(
# Expectation:
#   - What will/should work: security on secret / non-secret, and combining this to regio info, when it is combined in the query.
#   - No region inforamtion in the query should include all objects independent of the region.
