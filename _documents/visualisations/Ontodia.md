Ontodia is an interactive visualisation tool. That means, you can point it to an rdf store, and then, based on the available ontology in the 
store, access both the ontology and the data in the store. I’ll show you how, but first some necessary information on installing and running it.

## Installation ##
Ontodia is a seperate repository on github, you can find it [here](https://github.com/metaphacts/ontodia). It is also part of the [Metaphacts](https://metaphacts.com/) offering, where you can get an up to date licensed version. However the version [here](https://github.com/metaphacts/ontodia) is still usable. 

The install is simple: clone the repo, then follow the [build and run instructions](https://github.com/metaphacts/ontodia/wiki/Build-and-run).
