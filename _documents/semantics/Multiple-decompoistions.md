## Multiple Simultaneous Decompositions

As indicated above, organizations often employ multiple decompositions to address various perspectives and requirements. For example, an engineering team might use a decomposition based on the systems that can be distinguished in a product, while a maintenance team might use a decomposition based on physical location or the machines that make up a production line.

Given the fact that these simultaneous decompositions exist, two interesting questions arise:
- [What is the nature of a decomposition, and what makes it what it is?]( decomposition-nature )
- [How do decompositions relate to each other?]( decompositions-linkage )
