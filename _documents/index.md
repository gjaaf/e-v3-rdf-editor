### Welcome 

This site is about semantic technology, especially knowledge
graphs. It's about ontologies, taxonomies, and all the other fancy
terms that make normal people take a running leap in the other
direction.

I hope you find it useful. I’ve added a commenting option to the
site. It’s using GitHub Discussions. I’m assuming that people
interested in the stuff I write about will have a GitHub account or
know how to get one. Otherwise, contact me at gja at freeshell dot
org.


Cheers,

-=GJ=-
