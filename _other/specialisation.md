## Archimate modelling
My personal opinion used to be ’Archimate is by architects for
architects, do not ever show an archimate view to someone that is not
an architect’. However nowadays my thinking changed. It seems a waste
of time to first model in Archimate and then remodel in Powerpoint or
what other tool you may use. Given the increasing speed of change, I
think we should aim for Arhimate views that are directly usable as
models for non-architects.  Hosiaisluoma, in his Archimate cookbook, 
gives some examples of views that are understandable by
non-architects, by, for example, adding grouping information to guide the viewer.

I think another way to help the viewer to understand Archimate models
is by using the specialisation options of Archimate, to create speecialized 
components that give more context to the viewer and that help
Architects to better expresse and transfer the meaning of the model.

A secondiry reason to add specialsation si that I think that, if you
want to meaningfull describe the enterprise, there are more elements
that are important, than just the abstract ones that the standard
defines. Below a listing of some of them can be found. By no means
this is meant as being complete it is just a series of examples. In
the final part of this series these specialized models will be used to
create new, more dynamic views in Archimate. I’ll mostly focus on the
business layer as this where many of the business users of Archimate
views will be interested in.

## Specializing Archimate business Components
In addition to the core elements explicitly modeled in the ArchiMate
business layer, as said, I think several important aspects of a
business are crucial for a comprehensive understanding of operations
and strategy, yet may not be explicitly represented. These include for
example:

1. [**Budgets and Financials**](Budgets-and-financials): Details regarding budget allocations
   for departments, projects, and initiatives, which influence
   decision-making and resource allocation.

2. **Headcounts and Human Resources**: Information on employee roles,
   skill sets, availability, and overall workforce management, which
   affect capacity planning and project execution.

3. **[Project Information](Project Information)**: The current status of things (like in
   progress, on hold, completed, to be decided, stopped etc.),
   including milestones, timelines, and deliverables, which provide
   insight into operational performance.

4. **Stakeholder Relationships**: Information about stakeholders,
   their interests, and influence on business processes, which can
   impact strategic goals and project success.

5. **Performance Metrics and KPIs**: Quantitative measures and
   baselines that evaluate the success of business processes,
   products, and services, helping to ensure alignment with strategic
   objectives.

6. **Risks and Compliance Factors**: Organizational risks, regulatory
   compliance requirements, and audit trails, which must be managed to
   mitigate adverse impacts on business operations.

7. **Cultural and Organizational Dynamics**: Elements that describe
   the organization's culture, communication styles, and informal
   structures that can affect collaboration and effectiveness.

8. **Customer Insights and Feedback**: Information related to customer
   behavior, preferences, and satisfaction levels, which inform
   product development and service enhancements.

By incorporating these critical elements into the broader EA
framework, I think organizations can achieve a more holistic view of
their operations and make better-informed strategic
decisions. Integrating these aspects with ArchiMate modeling can
enhance its utility in driving business transformation and alignment.

Of the above list I will detail [Budgets and
Financials](Budgets-and-financials) and [Project Information](Project Information), is discussed a series of sub-stories. The rest may be a topic
for later investigations. In general I think there are many more specialisations that help to guide the user / viewer into udnerstanding what is showed.
