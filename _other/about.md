### Enterprise Architecture

My day job, currently. Given my interest in Semantics, a focus on
Archimate is the primary point of interest.  However, as I think that
enterprise architecture is much more than the rather narrow focus of
just a business layer, an application layer and an infrastructure
layer, I’ll be investigating extending Archimate into other
area’s. And, probably needless to say, I’ll see if I can link up
Enterprise Architecture tooling with semantic tooling.

I hope you find it interesting!
