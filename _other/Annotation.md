## Annotation
Something that I think is overlooked is the option to annotate
Archimate elements in views. The reason it is overlooked, is of course
that is not part of the Archimate standard. However Archi Supports it,
and I think Annotation is essential for meaningfull views.

Apart from that, as we will see in the final aprt of this series:
annotations are a vital part of changing architecture from a
descriptive activity to a pro-active activity.

### A textual example

![Sources](../../../../assets/HC-constraint example.png)

The scetch expresses that the Developement Department has to meet a maximum headcount contstraint of 20 employees, and which is currently exceeded by 3.


### A visual example:

![Sources](../../../../assets/Annotation-status-indication.png)

Here the phases are associated to a business object that indicates the status of the phase.

The statusses could of course be extended (over budget, reconsider,
etc.). Then it would be easy to select all phases of all projects that
are, for example, over budget, and create views over them.
