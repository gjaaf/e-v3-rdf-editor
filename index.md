RDF editor is a research project that Is started when working for the
Dutch Government on an project where large amounts of Linked Data were
exchanged. My professional expertise is Linked Data, and I noticed
that there was very limited tooling available to work with the sets we
received and send out. It was there that the [central questions] arose
that were answered by the creation of this tool.

As the project is more or less completed, and (being an avid user of
emacs), some people might see this as useful or may find inspiration
in it for other projects, I'm documenting the RDF-Editor here.

I may do more work on this, or it may be that other research areas are
to me of more interest and that will find higher priorities. Contact
me if you want to discuss possible next steps where I could be of
help.
