## Where to find

Currently, the RDF editor is not yet a public repository on
GitHub. This is partly because it is quite brittle, and partly because
I have not yet done a full review of the code to remove possible
development notes to myself. I intend to fully open-source it if there
is demand. To lower expectations a bit: I'm not a professional
developer, so for the first people using it, there will likely be work
to get it into a workable state, I expect.
