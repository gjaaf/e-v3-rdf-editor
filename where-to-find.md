Currently RDF-editor is not yet a public repo on Github. Partly
because it is quite brittle, and partly becasue I have not yet done a
full review of the code to remove possible development notes to
self. I intend to fully open source this if there is demand. To lower
expectations a bit: I'm not a proffesional developer so for the first
people using it, there will be work to get it in a workable state, I
expect.
