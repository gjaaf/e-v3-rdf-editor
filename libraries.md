## Versions and packages
  
The RDF editor was built on Emacs version 29.

The tree view is based on the excellent tree-view package by Tilman Rassy. Also, the directory tree view is directly taken from his package. Find his repositories here: [github timlanrassy](https://github.com/tilmanrassy). Both packages are also available on [Melpa](https://melpa.org).

The OpenStreetMap display is based on the OSM package. Find it here on GitHub: [osm](https://github.com/minad/osm).

The SPARQL page is based on `sparql-mode`, which you can find here: [sparql-mode](https://github.com/ljos/sparql-mode) and on [Melpa](https://melpa.org).

The PostgreSQL analysis was made using PGMacs by Eric Marsden, which can be found here: [PGmacs](https://github.com/emarsden/pgmacs) and on [Melpa](https://melpa.org). Eric also gave a [talk](https://emacsconf.org/2024/talks/pgmacs/) at EmacsConf 2024.

I've used the `eye-browse` package extensively. It allows you to switch back and forth between the application and the development environment. Find it also on [Melpa](https://melpa.org).
