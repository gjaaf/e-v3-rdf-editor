RDF-editor was build on Emacs version 29.

The treeview is based on the excelant treeview package of Tilman Rassy. Also the dir-treeview is directly taken from his packages. Find his repos here: [github timlanrassy](https://github.com/tilmanrassy). Both packages are also on [Melpa](https://melpa.org).

The Openstreetview display is based on the OSM package. Find it here on Github: [osm](https://github.com/minad/osm).

The sparql page is based on sparql-mode which you can find here [sparql-mode](https://github.com/ljos/sparql-mode) and on [Melpa](https://melpa.org).

The PostgreSQL analysis was made using PGMacs by Eric Marsden which can be found here [PGmacs](https://github.com/emarsden/pgmacs) and on [Melpa](https://melpa.org). Eric also did a [talk](https://emacsconf.org/2024/talks/pgmacs/) on emacs Conf 2024. 

I've used the eye-browse package extensively, it allows to swithc back an forth between the application and the development environment. find also this on [Melpa](https://melpa.org).
